A Questionnaire/Project that was required to make it through to the final round for the Quantitative Analyst position for the Phillies.

I applied for the Quantitative Analyst Associate position in the Fall of 2022. This was the project they had us submit to make it to the final interview. I completed it and submitted it while keeping up with my school work.
This project was good enough to make it to the final interview, however, I did not acquire the job. It was still a great experience interviewing for a team, albeit a rival team, being a Braves fan myself... (Maybe that's why I didn't get it)
